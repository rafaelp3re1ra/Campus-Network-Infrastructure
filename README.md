# Cablagem Estruturada - Campus-Network-Infrastructure

This repository contains all files and documentation related to the *Cablagem Estruturada* course (Structured Cabling) project. The project involved designing a complete network infrastructure for a campus, including equipment selection, topology planning, structured cabling, and budgeting.  

## Project Overview  
In this project, we planned the network infrastructure for a **high school campus**, ensuring optimal connectivity, redundancy, and scalability. Key aspects include:  

**Equipment Selection** – Routers, switches, access points, VoIP phones.  
**Topology Planning** – Hierarchical star model (ISO 11801) with structured cabling.  
**Cabling Design** – Optical fiber backbone (OM4) and Cat6 UTP horizontal cabling.  
**Budgeting** – Cost estimation for all network components and installation.  
**Network Services** – Database, VoIP, controlled internet access, and school management systems.  

## Network Topology  
The network follows a **hierarchical star topology** based on the **ISO 11801** standard:  
- **Campus Distributor**: Centralized in Pavilhão E for connectivity and security.  
- **Building Distributors**: One per building, linking to the campus backbone.  
- **Floor Distributors**: Ensuring redundancy and efficient connection within buildings.  
- **Horizontal Cabling**: Cat6 UTP cables connecting workstations and access points.  

## Infrastructure and Equipment  
- **Backbone**: OM4 optical fiber for high-speed connections between buildings.  
- **Switches**: D-Link and Ubiquiti smart managed switches.  
- **Router**: Fortinet FortiGate 400E for security and traffic management.  
- **Wireless**: TP-Link EAP660 HD access points with PoE support.  
- **VoIP**: Cisco IP Phone 7861 for communication.  
- **Power Backup**: APC Smart-UPS SRT for uninterrupted operation.  

## Budget Summary  
The total estimated cost for implementing this network infrastructure is **€99,028**. This includes active and passive equipment, cabling, ventilation, and network accessories. Detailed cost breakdown can be found in **Orçamento.xlsx**.  

## About the Course  
**Cablagem Estruturada** is a class focused on **structured cabling and network infrastructure**, teaching students how to **plan, install, and manage** network environments.
